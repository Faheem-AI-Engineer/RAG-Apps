# RAG Applications Repository 🚀

A repository for building and deploying **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applications, combining the power of large language models with efficient document retrieval systems.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This repository provides tools and pipelines to implement RAG-based systems for:
- **Question Answering** over custom documents
- **Document Summarization** with contextual retrieval
- **Chatbots** with domain-specific knowledge
- **Semantic Search** engines

Built with modern NLP libraries like:
- 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers
- 🦜 LangChain
- 🐍 Vectore Databases
- 🌐 APIS, Streamlit

---

## ✨ Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine dense vector search with keyword-based methods
- **Pre-trained Models**: Integration with LLMs like BERT, GPT-2, T5, etc.
- **Custom Document Loaders**: Support for PDFs, TXT, HTML, and Markdown
- **Efficient Indexing**: FAISS/HNSW for fast similarity search
- **API Ready**: Flask/FastAPI endpoints for deployment
