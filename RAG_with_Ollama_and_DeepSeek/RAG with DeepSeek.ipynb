ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.  \n",
      "In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose standardized categories in the rate reconciliation  in  both  percentage  and  dollar  amounts. ASU  2023-09  will  also require income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt ASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.\n",

      "Question: What are Debt Securities Total value in $\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out the total value of debt securities as of September 30, 2024, based on the context provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me look at what's given. The context mentions that as of September 30, 2024, we had $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. These include various types like time deposits, money market funds, government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the question is specifically about debt securities, not all marketable securities. So I need to focus on the parts that are debt-related.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at the context, it doesn't mention anything directly about debt securities except for marketable equity securities. So maybe the $93.2 billion includes cash equivalents and other marketable securities but excludes debt securities like corporate debt or government debt?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, that might be a problem because if all the marketable securities are part of cash and equivalents, then the total would not have any debt components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The context says \"Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\" which includes time deposits, money market funds, government bonds, corporate debt, mortgage-backed, asset-backed, and marketable equity. But if all these are considered as cash equivalents or short-term marketable securities, then maybe the total of those isn't a separate debt security.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if the question is about the total value of debt securities in $, but from the context, I don't see any figures related to corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed, asset-backed, or government debt. Therefore, it's possible that the answer might be \"Not available\" because there isn't enough information provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if all marketable securities are considered cash equivalents, then perhaps the total $93.2 billion doesn't include any debt securities. That would mean the total value of debt securities is zero based on the given data.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The context does not provide specific figures for debt securities such as corporate debt, government debt, or other types. Therefore, the total value of debt securities cannot be determined from the provided information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "     The total value of debt securities is not available in the context.\n",
